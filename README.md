# Heart Disease Classification Analysis

<img src='dataset-cover.jpg'>

This project aims to develop and validate a machine learning model for predicting wether or not a patient has heart disease, with a measurement of success set to approx. `95%` prediction accuracy.

## Project Data
The dataset used in this analysis dates back from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The target field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

<b>Data Dictionary</b>:
1. age
2. sex (0: female, 1: male)
3. cp = chest pain type (4 values)
4. trestbps = resting blood pressure
5. chol = serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fsb = fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. restecg = resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8. thalach = maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang = exercise induced angina
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope = the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. ca = number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal = thalium stress result (0: normal, 1: fixed defect, 2: reversable defect)
